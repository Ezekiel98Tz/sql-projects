# Healthcare System SQL Project

## Overview

This project simulates a simplified healthcare management database designed to model key operations within a medical facility. It covers patient management, doctor assignments, appointment scheduling, treatment records, prescription tracking, and billing workflows.

The goal is to build a scalable, real-world applicable schema with corresponding seed data and insightful queries to enhance SQL proficiency and practical database skills.

---

## Project Structure

- `schema.sql`: Defines the database schema including tables for Departments, Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Treatments, Prescriptions, and Bills.
- `seed_data.sql`: Populates the database with sample data to simulate hospital operations, including doctors, patients, appointments, treatments, prescriptions, and billing records.
- `queries.sql`: Contains key SQL queries for retrieving actionable insights such as upcoming appointments, billing summaries, treatment histories, and prescription details.

---

## Key Features

- Relational design with foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Use of appropriate data types and constraints, including status enumerations and unique fields.
- Modular file organization facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.
- Realistic data simulation to support complex querying and reporting scenarios.

---

## How to Use

1. Run `schema.sql` to create the database schema.
2. Execute `seed_data.sql` to populate the database with sample data.
3. Use `queries.sql` to explore example queries and adapt them for reporting or analytics purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration of lab results and diagnostics.
- Patient insurance and payment plans management.
- Support for multi-doctor consultations and referrals.
- Advanced reporting with views and stored procedures.
